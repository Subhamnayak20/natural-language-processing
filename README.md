# natural-language-processing
This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) experiments and models developed using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Deep Learning techniques. All the code in this project is fully runnable, and the entire environment is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency and avoid OS-level package conflicts.

i have practiced natural language processing, it have comple detail from start to end

All the required datasets are stored in the dataset folder
